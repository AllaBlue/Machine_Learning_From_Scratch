## Machine Learning From Scratch

Welcome to the **Machine Learning From Scratch** repository! This repository showcases my journey in implementing various machine learning algorithms from the ground up as well as leveraging the power of scikit-learn. 

### What's Inside:
- **Custom Implementations**: Step-by-step coding of fundamental machine learning algorithms without relying on high-level libraries, providing a deep understanding of the mechanics behind them.
- **Scikit-learn Implementations**: Efficient and optimized versions of the same algorithms using the popular scikit-learn library, demonstrating best practices and practical applications.
- **Projects and Examples**: Real-world projects and examples that illustrate the application of these algorithms to various datasets.

### Features:
- Comprehensive documentation and comments for each algorithm.
- Comparative analysis of custom implementations versus scikit-learn implementations.
- Visualization and evaluation metrics for model performance.

Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the basics or an experienced practitioner interested in the nitty-gritty details of machine learning algorithms, this repository has something for everyone.

Feel free to explore and use it!
